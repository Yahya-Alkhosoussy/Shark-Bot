# This is the patch notes for the shark catch game given on the 12th of February 2026:
It's been an exciting few days now, can't wait to share what's been cooking!
## Fishing update!
- Decided it was time to give fishing a big buff in use since it was basically only used to get quick cash (it's understandable, we all need cash).
### NEW: Baits
- Baits is the latest system implemented to help attract more sharks when fishing. Each bait increases the chances of getting a shark from 5% to a huge 35% chance, but beware as they are limited.
- Baits now give a massive 30% increase to getting a shark, but with a catch. There are 5 tiers of bait and the sharks you are able to attract are dependant on the tier you use.
- The following will be a list of baits you can buy:
  1. Chum - 15 coins per piece.
  2. Bait ball - 30 coins per piece.
  3. Mackerel - 45 coins per piece.
  4. Stingray - 60 coins per piece.
  5. Barracuda - 75 coins per piece.
- The following are what each bait attracts:
  1. Chum - Very common sharks.
  2. Bait ball - Common sharks.
  3. Mackerel - Uncommon sharks.
  4. Stingray - Rare sharks.
  5. Barracuda - Ultra rare sharks.
## Shark Game:
- Ever wondered why you could use a net you don't own and it would not tell you you don't own it? well that's fixed now. The bot will tell you if you use a net you don't own and it still defaults to the rope net.
## Leveling System:
Massive changes incoming
### Bug fixes:
- Fixed a bug where sometimes people would not get added to the system even though they joined normally.
- Fixed a bug where XP needed was way way way way too high and now everyone should be at the correct level according to how much XP they've earned so far.
### Changes:
- The XPs needed for each level has been changed. It is now even simpler than before. For the first 5 levels:
  1. Level 1: 50 XP
  2. Level 2: 100 XP
  3. Level 3: 150 XP
  4. Level 4: 200 XP
  5. Level 5: 250 XP
You see the trend now don't you? Every level requires 50 xp more than the last.

# This is the patch notes for the shark catch game given on the 28th of February 2026:
I have been working on something for the past week, nothing major but it's exciting!

## Shark Catch Game:
### Bug Fixes:
- Fixed a bug where nets would not be deleted after all uses were used up, now you should be able to buy nets after running out and they won't be "invisible", if you still have an invisible net please use #open-a-ticket to open mod mail and let us know, this is just to keep track and for us to keep a history of it.

## Birthdays:
### NEW birthday wishes:
Instead of the bot giving people wishes on the first of the month, it now has been upgraded to give birthday wishes on the day!
Go to #add-birthday and enter /add-birthday then follow the prompts the bot gives and it will wish you a happy birthday on that day!!!

That's it. Short update as we plan more ahead!
